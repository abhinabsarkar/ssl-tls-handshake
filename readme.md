# SSL/TLS Handshake
Whenever we browse a **HTTPS** secured site using a browser or a client application server communicates with another server using **HTTPS**, the information exchanged is encrypted at the transport layer. This is done via SSL/TLS handshake during which the client and the server establish a secure connection.
